# Yotpo Kafka Gem in Ruby

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yotpo-ruby-kafka'
```
###Broker Definition
1. Pass as an argument on producer/consumer initialization
2. Define as an env var - BROKER_URL
3. Defaults to 127.0.0.1

###Failure Monitoring
Define influxdb env vars on your service -INFLUXDB_DB, INFLUXDB_HOST, INFLUXDB_PORT  

### Creating a producer:

```ruby
require 'yotpo_kafka'
...
YotpoKafka::Producer.new.publish(topic, message, headers, key)
...

```
* **_topic:_** name of the topic to publish to (can also be an array of topics)

* **_message:_** string to publish

* _**headers:**_ kafka headers map

* _**key:**_ messages with same key will go to same partition. Order within
        a partition is ensured and therefore all messages with same key
        will be sent synchronicly. Advised to use when order of messages
        is required.Default: nil
        
### Creating a consumer:
A consumer will be defined in a rake task as follows:

```ruby
require 'yotpo_kafka'

  desc 'New Consumer'
  task :new_consumer do
      Consumers::DummyConsumer.new({
                                    seconds_between_retries: 10,
                                    num_retries: 3,
                                    topics: 'rubytest',
                                    group_id: 'consumer_test_topics',
                                   }).start_consumer
  end
```
* _**topics:**_ name of the topic to publish to (or an array of topics)

* **_group_id:_** consumer will be part of consumer group with given id (One for all topics)

* **_handler:_** class that handles the consumed messages payload
```ruby
require 'yotpo_kafka'

module Consumers
  class ApplicationNameFromCode < YotpoKafka::Consumer
    def consume_message(_message);
    end
  end
end
```
* _**seconds_between_retries:**_ in seconds.

* _**num_retries:**_ num of retries of re-consuming message in case of exception. 
                       When retry is 0, failure is sent to fatal topic. Default is 0
                       
* _**logstash_logger:**_ if set to true, will log in Logstash format. Default is true

#### How to install Kafka locally for debugging needs:
##### Local installation
* brew cask install java8
* brew install kafka
* vim /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
```
Here uncomment the server settings and update the value from:

listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
to
listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
and restart the server and it will work great.
```
Some commands to start:
* zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties
* kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
* kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test
* kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test
* kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning

##### Using dockers
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
