      Consumers::DummyConsumer.new({
                                    seconds_between_retries: 10,
                                    num_retries: 3,
                                    topics: 'rubytest',
                                    group_id: 'consumer_test_topics',
                                   }).start_consumer

Here uncomment the server settings and update the value from:

listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
to
listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
and restart the server and it will work great.

4. zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties
kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties

5. Create Kafka Topic:
kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test

6. Initialize Producer console:
kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test

7. Initialize Consumer console:
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
```

#### Using dockers
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
